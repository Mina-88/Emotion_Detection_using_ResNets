# Emotion_Detection_using_ResNets

### The dataset was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer

This is an attempt to detect emotions from images that are present in an online dataset. The model that is used here is a variation of ResNet which uses skip connections to solve the problems that arise from using deep neural networks. The model got an accuracy of 61% on 7 classes after 30 epochs trained on a local machine.
